# Key Areas of Analysis

	Product Line Analysis.

# Source of Data

Obtained the data from Kaggle data sets. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aungpyaeap/supermarket-sales  . 

The data was already refined and clean. I did not find any inconsistencies nor a need for further data cleaning.

# Data Analysis

I use a pivot table to summarize the data to suit analysis areas and slicer to provide a wider analysis.

**	Product Line Analysis**

To analyse the performance of each product line to identify bestselling product and how each products performs across various cities and branches.

I used various 1 pivot tables to identify best-selling product and linked it to a monthly slicer to identify best-selling product per month. Food and beverage was the most popular product in all months. 

I used two pivot tables to analyse performance of each product across the branches and cities and linked it to product line slicer. 
These insights guides in making a decision on where to sell each product optimally.

**	Sales Analysis**

To analyse sales volume for each product and their profitability. Also sales to analyse branch and city sales together with their profitability.

I used various pivot tables to come up with branch and city sales as well as their profitability. Branch C and Naypyidaw city was the top performers While Branch B and Mandalay City was the least performers.

The sales and profitability insights provide the overall performance of the supermarket. It helps come up strategies to capitalize on the best performing branches and address the least performing ones.

**	Customer Analysis.**

Based on the data analysed, there are two customer types, members and Normal. Used a pivot table to identify frequent customer type across cities and branches. Members were the frequent customers This insight will guide in strategic marketing decisions.
